Facebook is a social networking website where users can post comments,
share photographs, and 
post links to news or other interesting content on the web, 
chat live, 
and watch short-form video.
Shared content can be made publicly accessible, or
it can be shared only among a select group of friends or 
family via Facebook Groups, or 
with a single person.
